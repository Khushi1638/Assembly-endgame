# The Assembly Endgame: Guess & Speculate

Welcome to **The Assembly Endgame**, a unique and intellectually stimulating word-guessing game built with React! This project is an extension of the foundational concepts learned from Bob Ziroll's React course on Scrimba, enhanced with creative new features that deliver a fresh and thought-provoking experience.

## ðŸŽ® About the Game

**The Assembly Endgame** reimagines the classic word-guessing formula. Instead of simple, direct clues, you'll be presented with abstract, poetic, or philosophical hints. Your goal? To speculate, intuit, and connect subtle meanings to uncover the hidden word.

It's not just about logic â€” it's about insight.

1. A poetic or abstract hint appears on the screen.
